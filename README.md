Learning with Flutter SDK and Android Studio Editor

Hi! I am new to Flutter and Android Studio.
I have used the following links:
1) https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1#0

Set Flutter and Android with:
	https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
Go to Market Place in Android Studio
	-> Install Flutter plugin and Dart plugin.

Open Android Studio (Preferably 21)
	1) Click on "New Flutter App"
	2) Add your Flutter SDK Path ([Path to Extracted]\flutter_windows_3.0.3-stable\flutter)
	3) Give a name to your app.
	4) By default(Not Important) -> The Android Language : Kotlin
								 -> The IOS Language : Swift
	5) Click finish

Project Opens:
	1) Click "View" -> "Tool Windows" -> "Project"
	2) A SideBar opens. On the top left Corner -> Select "Project"

Create your own Android Emulator(i.e. VM of any Android Version)
	Go tot the AVD Manager with: Click "View" -> "Tool Windows" -> "Device Manager"	
	https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds
	When you successfully launch your Emulator, switch it off (by the dummy power button in the side Toolbar) and then close the Emulator.
	In the Device Manager, for any existing Emulator, we have other options like Restart, Wipe Data, Duplicate etc.
